# Toolkit for Hawkes Processes in Python


## Goal

The purpose of this package is to provide the `Python` community with 
a complete suite of cutting-edge tools specifically tailored for 
the study of exponential Hawkes processes, with a particular focus 
on high-dimensional framework. It notably features:

  * A efficient cluster-based simulation method for generating events.

  * A highly versatile and flexible framework for performing inference of 
    multivariate Hawkes process with exponential kernel. 

  * Introduces novel approaches to address the challenge of multiclass 
    classification within the supervised learning framework.


## Installation

`Sparkle` can also be installed from sources using
```bash
git clone https://github.com/romain-e-lacoste/sparkle
